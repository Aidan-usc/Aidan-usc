        <h2>Problem statement: Cola Commuter</h2>
        <p>
          The transportation provided by the university or lack thereof, is not enough for the everyday college student.
          The busses either aren't on time, being too early or too late, or their stops are in inconvenient spots where 
          the 20-minute walk would be faster.
