    <h2>Problem statement: Student Transportation</h2>
    <p>
     The transportation provided by the university or lack thereof, is not enough for the everyday college student.
     The busses either aren't on time, being too early or too late, or their stops are in inconvenient spots
     where the 20-minute walk would be faster.

    <p>
       For our affinity diagram regarding transportation for students on campus, we covered 5 major categories.  Those include E-Bikes, E-Scooters,
       an application to track those E-Transports, Student Bus Transportation, and charging stations for any electric transportation devices that
       may be necessary.  We attempted to devise the best possible solutions to our problem by detailing what we believe is necessary for students
       to have a more enjoyable on-campus experience at USC.
